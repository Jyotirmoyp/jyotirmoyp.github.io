  (1) I came to Bayreuth when the autumn leaves were falling. The streets adorned themselves with the red and yellow hues of nature's pigments. I arrived in Bayreuth when every leaf was a flower. The winter was yet to arrive; nevertheless, my warm skin from the land of sun and shadow was already craving for the comforting embrace of warmth.

 (2) Just beside my room, a beautiful Franconian hotel stood, veiled behind the autumn tree. Its quaint, timber-framed architecture peeked through the vibrant orange and gold leaves, creating a picturesque scene straight out of a storybook. The crisp autumn air carried the faint scent of woodsmoke and fallen leaves. </p>

   (3) Along Richard Wagner Strasse,I saw a collection of modern houses that were different from the traditional Franconian architectures of timber frames and steeply pitched roofs. These homes are distinctly colorful, adding a vibrant touch to the streetscape.    </p>

   (4) The city was home to many parks and gardens. One day, I strolled through the famous garden, Ermitage. The air was heavy with moisture, yet filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the gentle rustling of leaves. It felt as though nature itself was whispering secrets. Every leaf was like a flower.

   <p style="text-align:justify;">   

   (5) Just outside the town, there stands another castle, its ancient walls whispering tales of a bygone era. Fresh snow has just blanketed the outskirts, creating a pristine white canvas that sparkles under the winter sun. This is a typical Franconian landscape, where the harmony between history and nature is evident in every snow-covered tree and every serene, quiet path.

    (6) That palace was known as the palace of fantasy. A silent lake nestled nearby, its tranquil waters mirroring the ethereal beauty of the surroundings. A solitary, snow-covered home stood nearby, seemingly untouched and waiting for inhabitants who never arrived.

	(9) On Christmas Day, the city got a lot of snow. A white chrismas, like a scene from a holiday postcard. The city center stood in tranquil 	solitude. The quietude was punctuated only by my soft crunch of footsteps in the snow and the chiming of church bells.    </p>

 (11) I was savoring the cityscape amidst the deep snow. Behind the city centre, there lay a park named Hofgarten. Within it, a small pool and a water fountain stood frozen and lifeless.   </p>

  (12) Near the city flows a small river known as the Rotter Main. On that same day, I strolled along the snowy banks of the River Main, enjoying the serene beauty of the winter landscape reflected in its thin water.   </p>

 <p style="text-align:justify;">   

 (14) I continued walking for several more miles until all signs of human presenceâ€”the river, houses, and any semblance of civilizationâ€”vanished. Ahead lay only an expansive, eternal snow field, stretching endlessly under the vast sky.

(16) On the 31<sup>st</sup> of December, I arrived in Bamberg. It was my first break, and luckily, the weather was sunny. I stood near the hanging Rathaus, the most iconic building in the city, marveling at its unique architecture and soaking in the charm of Bamberg.

  (17) The Bamberg Cathedral was immense, unlike any cathedral I had ever seen. As the largest in Bavaria, its grandeur was truly awe-inspiring. I spent some time there, basking in the winter sun and absorbing the gothic essence of its architecture.

(20)January arrived, and the snow grew thicker. On a Saturday, I joined a Bayreuth city tour to Fichtelgebirge. The tour included free transport and a guided hike to the mountain's summit. The hike was delightful, winding through a snow-covered jungle, offering breathtaking views and a serene winter wonderland experience.

(21) A Russian photographer named Marco was with me. He pointed out the fascinating snow patterns on the tree stems. During high winds, white snow adheres to the side opposite the wind, leaving the other side dark. In the depths of the jungle, amidst towering trees, these patterns created a striking zebra effect. It looked remarkably like a Japanese painting, with natureâ€™s artistry on full display.

   (22) There were others in the group as well. I didn't know German, and they knew very little English, so conversation was minimal. A lady brought her dog, who resembled my own Coco, a brown-colored Indie pup. The dog provided me with some company during the hike.

(23) While returning from the mountain, I came across Fichtelsee, a lake that now showed no trace of water under its icy cover. Intrigued, I made a plan to visit this spot again in the summer to witness its true beauty. Indeed, I returned during the warmer months and captured its splendor. I'll share a picture of that visit later.

  (24) One day in the middle of February, the snow melted in Franconia, and the sun graced us for a few hours. I opened my balcony for the first time in several months. The wind was still crisp and chilly, but the warmth of the sun felt like a drop of water in a barren desert. From my window, I could see the train station, Wegner's opera house, and the distant mountains of Franconian Switzerland.  In that moment, I realized just how much the sun truly makes me happy.

(25) And finally, I saw people on the street. They were happyâ€”some were singing, children were running and playing. I could see the glimps of spring in the small Franconian town, bringing with it a renewed sense of joy and life.

  (27) One weekend, I planned to visit Nuremberg, the largest city of Franconia. Nuremberg, famous for its historical significanceâ€”the place where the war ended! Paved with history in every corner, the city quickly became my most beloved place. It was a place where I could spend time and made me happy.

The square now stands as a reminder of both the city's resilience and the stories it holds, layered within its stones and architecture.
